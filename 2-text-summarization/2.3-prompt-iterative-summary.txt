Generate increasingly concise entity-dense summaries of this PDF file.

Repeat the following 2 steps 4 times in a row (I call them rounds). 

Step 1: Identify 1-3 informative entities (delimited) from the article which are missing from the previously generated summary. Do not add any entities that are not essential to the article content. 
Step 2: Write a new denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the missing entities. 

A missing entity is 
- Relevant: to the main stories. 
- Specific: descriptive yet concise (4 words or fewer). 
- Novel: not in the previous summary. 
- Faithful: present in the article. 
- Meaningful: relevant to the understanding of the articleâ€™s message. 
- Anywhere: located in the article. 

Guidelines: 
- The first statement should be long (5-10 sentences), highly non-specific, containing little arguments supporting the notion of interest beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., "it is considered that") to reach ~200 words. 
- Rewrite the previous statement to improve flow and make space for additional entities. 
- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "it is considered that". 
- The statements should become increasingly rich, highly dense, and argumentative in nature, yet self-contained. 
- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new statement. 
- Never drop entities from the previous statement. 

Answer in a narrative form where each section is titled as "Summary round [respective number]". The subheadings are "Missing entities" and "Denser statement".
