I was given the responsibility to arrange an internal company event for data science and analytics team members from our company who are located around the world and work in different business units. Generate ideas for an activitiy that will help with breaking ice at the beginning of the event and will help with sharing ideas and best practices between different team members. I'd like to add that the event is going to be taking place in person. So all of the participants will be physically present in a single location specificially for this event.
